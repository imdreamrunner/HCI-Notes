##Guidelines & Principles

###Introduction

####Three levels
1. Theories: **High-level** that describes objects and actions with consistent terminology to support communication & teaching. This can be used to ***predict*** performance, errors, understanding, satisfaction of user.
2. Principles: **Middle-level** practices that can be applied to different guidelines, analyzing and comparing design alternative.
3. *Guidelines*: **Design-level** practices and rules that make for good and consistent design( some based on theory).

###Guidelines

####Definition
Guidelines were developed in the "early days"
* Best **practices**
* From **experience**
* Good starting point for all projects involving a UI
* Developed **"Shared language"**, for example, Widget Names, Functionality name, etc.

####Components
Rule:
  * Provides cures for design problems
  * Provides cautions for potential danger
  * Reminders based on experience 

Examples:
  * Give details on how a design must be performed
  * Style, color usage, window apearance, etc
  * Interaction usage
  * Require all developers to follow the guidelines

Documents:
  * Any serious large-scale UI design should have a "Guideline Document"
  * Provides a "Shared language" that developers and customers can use
  * Allows consistency within a design team
  * Guidelines document is not trivial

####Examples
Display organization guidelines:
 * Consistency of data display
 * Efficient information assimilation by the user
 * Minimal memory load on the user
 * Compatibility of data display with data entry
 * Flexibility for user control of data display
 * etc.

Data Entry guidelines:
 * Consistency of data-entry transactions
 * Minimal input actions by user
 * Minimal memory load
 * Compatibility of data entry with data display
 * Flexibility for user control
 * etc.

###Principles

 * Determine user's skill levels
  * Novice/First-Time users
  * Knowledge-able Intermittent Users
  * Expert/Frequent Users
 * Indentify the tasks
  * Decomposition of high level tasks
  * Relative task frequencies
 * Choose Interaction Style
  1. Direct Manipulation
  2. Menu Selection
  3. Form-fill in
  4. Command Language
  5. Natural Language
 * 8 goldern rules of interface design
  1. Strive for consistency
  2. Cater to universal usability
  3. Offer informative feedback
  4. Design dialogs to yield closure
  5. Permit easy reversal of actions
  6. Support internal locus of control
  7. Reduce short term memory
  8. Prevent errors

###Theories

Seven stages of action theory by Donald Norman
 1. Forming the goal
 2. Forming the intention
 3. Specifying the action
 4. Executing the action
 5. Perceiving the system state
 6. Interpreting the system state
 7. Evaluating the outcome
