##Prototyping & Evaluating

###Ethnographic Observation

####Ethnographic Observation Steps
Preparation
  * Understand organization policies and work culture.
  * Familiarize yourself with the system and its history.
  * Set initial goals and prepare questions.
  * Gain access and permission to observe/interview.

Field Study
  * Establish rapport with managers and users.
  * Observe/interview users in their workplace and collect subjective/objective quantitative/qualitative data.
  * Follow any leads that emerge from the visits.

Analysis
  * Compile the collected data in numerical, textual, and multimedia databases.
  * Quantify data and compile statistics.
  * Reduce and interpret the data.
  * Refine the goals and the process used.

Reporting
  * Consider multiple audiences and goals.
  * Prepare a report and present the findings.

####Participatory design: Pros and cons
More user involvement brings
  * more accurate information about tasks.
  * more opportunity for users to influence design decisions.
  * a sense of participation that builds users' ego investment in successful implementation.
  * potential for increased user acceptance of final system.

On negative side, extensive user involvement may
  * be more costly.
  * lengthen the implementation period.
  * build antagonism with people not involved or whose suggestions rejected.
  * force designers to compromise their design to satisfy incompetent participants.

###Prototyping

UI Prototype ("mock up")
 * Does not have to be functional
 * Simply design the buttons, menus, etc
 * Can well be a hand drawn picture

Develop prototypes early, because it is very difficult and costly to make changes near the end of a project. May Provides a "vision" for both develops and clients.

####Why
 * Get feedback on our design faster
 * Experiment with alternative designs
 * Fix problems before code is written
 * Keep the design centered on the user

####Fidelity in Prototyping
Fidelity refers to the level of detail (LoD)
 * High fidelity, prototypes look like the final product.
 * Low fidelity, artists renditions with many details missing.

#####Low-fi Storyboards
 * What are storyboards? High-level representation of important user actions & consequences.
 * Where do storyboards come from? Film & animation.
 * Give you a "script" of important events.

#####High-Fi Mockuo
 * After interface is established, still room for more mockup.
 * High-Fidelity can look much more similar to final product.
 * Paper-based may still be used OK, but most likely using real code and software.

####Prototypes Feedback
Previews and feedback from prototypes is crucial even low fidelity mockups. If possible, get feedback from experts & average users.

###Evaluating

The determinants of the evaluation plan include:
 * stage of design (early, middle, late)
 * novelty of project (well defined vs. exploratory)
 * number of expected users
 * criticality of the interface (life-critical medical system vs. museum exhibit support)
 * costs of product and finances allocated for testing
 * time available
 * experience of the design and evaluation team

Troubling aspect of testing: uncertainty remains even after exhaustive testing by multiple methods.(Reason)
 * Perfection is not possible in complex human endeavors, so must continue assessing and repairing problems during lifecycle of interface
 * Decision must be made about completing prototype testing and delivering the product, even though problems may continue to be found
 * Most testing methods will account fro normal usage, but performance in unpredictable situations with high levels of input such as nuclear reactor control, is extremely hard to test.

####Expert Reviews
Expert reviews entail one-half day to one week effort, although a lengthy training period may sometimes be required to explain the task domain or operational procedures.

Methods chose from:
 * Heuristic evaluation
 * Guidelines review
 * Consistency inspection
 * Cognitive walkthrough
 * Formal usability inspection

Issues:
* Expert reviews can be scheduled at several points in the development process when experts are available and when the design team is ready for feedback.
* Different experts tend to find different problems in an interface, so 3-5 expert reviewers can be highly productive, as can complementary usability testing.
* The dangers with expert reviews are that the experts may not have an adequate understanding of the task domain or user communities.
* Even experienced expert reviewers have great difficulty knowing how typical users, especially first-time users will really behave.

####Usability Testing and Laboratories
 * Usability testing not only sped up many projects but has also produced dramatic cost savings.
 * The movement towards usability testing stimulated the construction of usability laboratories.

#####Usability Lab
A typical modest usability lab would have two 10 by 10 foot areas, one for the participants to do their work and another, separated by a half-silvered mirror, for the testers and observers.

Participants should be chosen to represent the intended user communities, with attention to background in computing, experience with the task, motivation, education, and ability with the natural language used in the interface.

**Usability Lab variations: Videotaping**

Videotaping participants performing tasks is often valuable for later review and for showing designers or managers the problems that users encounter. (Reviewing videotaping is tedious, so careful logging and annotation is vital on finding critical incidents).

**Usability Lab variations: Think Aloud**

Participants carry out tasks while saying what they are thinking, and tester records thoughts.
 * Tester does not take over or give instructions, but prompt and listen for clues how they are dealing with the interface.
 * Think-aloud technique yield interesting clues for the tester.

**Usability Lab variations: More**
 * Paper mockups
 * Discount usability testing
 * Competitive usability testing
 * Universal usability testing
 * Field test and portable labs
 * Remote usability testing
 * Can-you-break-this tests

####Survey Instruments
Written user surveys are a familiar, inexpensive and generally acceptable companion for usability tests and expert reviews.

Key to successful surveys:
 * Clear goals in advance.
 * Development of focused items that help attain the goals.

Users could be asked for their subjective impressions about specific aspects of the interface such as the representation of:
 * task domain objects and actions.
 * syntax of inputs and design of displays.

Other goals would be ascertain
 * users background
 * experience with computers
 * job responsibilities
 * personality style
 * reasons for not using an interface
 * familiarity with features
 * their feeling state after using an interface
