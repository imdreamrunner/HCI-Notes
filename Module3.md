##Prototyping & Evaluating

###Ethnographic Observation

####Ethnographic Observation Steps
Preparation
  * Understand organization policies and work culture.
  * Familiarize yourself with the system and its history.
  * Set initial goals and prepare questions.
  * Gain access and permission to observe/interview.

Field Study
  * Establish rapport with managers and users.
  * Observe/interview users in their workplace and collect subjective/objective quantitative/qualitative data.
  * Follow any leads that emerge from the visits.

Analysis
  * Compile the collected data in numerical, textual, and multimedia databases.
  * Quantify data and compile statistics.
  * Reduce and interpret the data.
  * Refine the goals and the process used.

Reporting
  * Consider multiple audiences and goals.
  * Prepare a report and present the findings.

####Participatory design: Pros and cons
More user involvement brings
  * more accurate information about tasks.
  * more opportunity for users to influence design decisions.
  * a sense of participation that builds users' ego investment in successful implementation.
  * potential for increased user acceptance of final system.

On negative side, extensive user involvement may
  * be more costly.
  * lengthen the implementation period.
  * build antagonism with people not involved or whose suggestions rejected.
  * force designers to compromise their design to satisfy incompetent participants.

###Prototyping

UI Prototype ("mock up")
 * Does not have to be functional
 * Simply design the buttons, menus, etc
 * Can well be a hand drawn picture

Develop prototypes early, because it is very difficult and costly to make changes near the end of a project. May Provides a "vision" for both develops and clients.

####Why
 * Get feedback on our design faster
 * Experiment with alternative designs
 * Fix problems before code is written
 * Keep the design centered on the user

####Fidelity in Prototyping
Fidelity refers to the level of detail (LoD)
 * High fidelity, prototypes look like the final product.
 * Low fidelity, artists renditions with many details missing.

#####Low-fi Storyboards
 * What are storyboards? High-level representation of important user actions & consequences.
 * Where do storyboards come from? Film & animation.
 * Give you a "script" of important events.

#####High-Fi Mockuo
 * After interface is established, still room for more mockup.
 * High-Fidelity can look much more similar to final product.
 * Paper-based may still be used OK, but most likely using real code and software.

####Prototypes Feedback
Previews and feedback from prototypes is crucial even low fidelity mockups. If possible, get feedback from experts & average users.
