####Participatory design: Pros and cons
More user involvement brings
  * more accurate information about tasks.
  * more opportunity for users to influence design decisions.
  * a sense of participation that builds users' ego investment in successful implementation.
  * potential for increased user acceptance of final system.
On negative side, extensive user involvement may
  * be more costly.
  * lengthen the implementation period.
  * build antagonism with people not involved or whose suggestions rejected.
  * force designers to compromise their design to satisfy incompetent participants
